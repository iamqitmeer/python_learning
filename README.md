I learned:

* Install Python and IDEs (PyScripter, PyCharm)
* First program and variables
* Input, output, type conversion
* Strings, operators, and comments
* If-else, logical and comparison operators
* Loops (for, while, break, continue)
* Data structures: list, tuple, set, dictionary
* Functions

This gives me a **strong base**.
